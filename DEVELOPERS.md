## Project structure

This is a [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) composed of 3 node packages in the `packages`.

## Developing

Run `npm run dev` to start developing. This commands starts the Stencil compiler for the components and the Sass compiler for the styles. Both in watch mode.

If you need to use a browser to test your development, please open a new shell prompt and run `npm run serve` to start a dev server.

## Testing

- `airship-styles` are tested using [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) using Docker both in CI and locally to have consistent results.
- `airship-components` are build using [stenciljs](http://stenciljs.com) and have 2 types of tests: `unit` and `e2e`.

### Continuous Integration
We're using CircleCI as our Continuous Integration server. It currently runs several jobs after each commit at github, to run lint and unit tests for 'components' and 'styles' (see `.circleci/config.yml` for more details).


### Visual regression testing
`Styles` package has visual regression testing. This way, we get notified when a change on styles break existing ones.

This kind of testing relies on a set of reference images that are approved. Subsequent test run the test comparing the results against the reference. Any mismatch will trigger an error and fail the build.

We use BackstopJS for these tests. It provides a Docker image that allow us to get the same result for test despite the working environment. The Docker image is the responsible for creating the references and the test images, whether is local or CI.

**Create image references**

You must create visual specs for every CSS component you create. Follow these steps:
- Create a `test` folder within the component folder.
- Create as many `html` as needed to check every possible state of the component.
- Create a `wadus.spec.js` that returns an array of specs consisting of the test label and the local `.html` file that asserts that scenario. The format is:

```
const Utils = require('../../test-utils');
const u = new Utils(__dirname);

module.exports = [
  u.spec('Tabs', 'tabs.html'),
  u.spec('Tabs XL', 'tabs-xl.html'),
  u.spec('Tabs accesible', 'tabs-accesible.html')
];
```

- Run `npm run test:build-references`. This will create the new references. Check them and, if they're OK, commit them to the project. `BackstopJS` will use these references from now on.

**Recreate image references**

If you make any change in an existing visual spec, run `npm run test:build-references`. This command recreates the reference and if there's any difference, the current git diff will tell you that there are changes in an existing reference.

If you're OK with the reference image, commit it.

**Running the tests locally**

You need a particular Docker image to run the tests. If you don't have Docker installed in your system, please refer to the official documentation to know how to install Docker in your system.

To run locally the visual regression test, type `npm run test:styles`. When finished, the command will open a HTML report.

### CircleCI Tools for developers
- CircleCI has a local CLI to run / test the jobs: See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/
- To (locally) Run a single JOB: `circleci build --job JOB_NAME` eg:
`circleci build --job test-unit:components` or `circleci build --job test-unit:styles`
- It seems it is not possible (yet) to run locally the whole workflow


## Commit style

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to have more consistent commits and autogenerate a changelog.

Feel free to write your regular commits as you want but ensure your PR has an associated conventional commit:

- Before the merge commit.
- Use squash and merge/rebase and merge button in github and use a conventionalcommit 

We usually use one of the following:

```
chore|fix|feat(styles|components|icons|chore|docs): message (#PR)

[optional description]

Fix #issue
```

### Workflow

The main branch is `master`, and should reflect the last published version. The branch with the new changes for the next **major** or **minor** release is `develop`.

We should follow this convention when creating branches:

* Features: `feature/<id>-<description>` (i.e: feature/624-donut-chart)
* Fixes: `fix/<id>-<description>`  (i.e: fix/617-size-point-distorted)
* Hotfix: `hotfix/<id>-<description>` (i.e: hotfix/618-round-histogram-seletion)
* Release (minor & major): `release/<version>` (i.e: release/v2.1.0)

As a rule of thumb:

- `Features` and `Fixes` are created from `develop` and the PR is opened against `develop`.
- `Release` should be created from `develop` and opened against `master`. See the 'Release' section for more details.
- `Hotfix` should be created from `master` and the PR opened against it as well.

Note: as soon as hotfixes are incorporated and released, `master` should be merged into develop. Develop must always be in sync with master.

## Releasing a new version

We use [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) wrapped with a npm script to keep all internal packages in sync.

### Prerelase

To release a 'beta' version of the current status of Airship (master / develop), you can use the following command:

    npm run publish:prerelease

This command will prompt you with what version you want to publish.

So for example we are in the version `2.3.12` and we merge branch with a hotfix.

```
tags   --- v2.3.12  ------------------------------>
master ---   A      ---------------------   B  --->
              \                            /
                --------- hotfix ----------
```

The new version should be `v2.3.13` but before making it public we want to do a little QA generating a release candidate or prerelease pointing to **B**.

```
tags   --- v2.3.12  --------------------- v2.3.13-rc ---->
master ---   A      ---------------------   B  ------------>
              \                            /
                --------- hotfix ----------
```

If you don't want to risk typing the wrong version, you can always use `npm run publish:prepatch` which will generate the correct one.

If you are on 2.3.12 and you want to publish a new feature on a minor, the prerelease version should be 2.4.0-rc. Alternatively, use `npm run publish:preminor`.

Likewise, if you plan on releasing a new major version, it should be 3.0.0-rc. Alternatively `npm run publish:preminor`.

Once our `prerelease` version is published the [prerelease version in the CDN](https://libs.cartocdn.com/airship-components/prerelease/airship.js) will point to `v2.3.13-rc` and the [prerelease dist-tag in NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carto/airship-components) will point to `v2.3.13-rc`.

You can also do this from develop to release previews of new features.

#### Finding and fixing bugs on a prerelease

There is a `smoke` folder under `packages` that has examples using the NPM and the CDN versions of Airship, they are always pointing to the latest prerelease. You can use those to check if anything obvious has broken during the release process.

If you find a bug and merge a fix branch into master the new version should be `v2.4.0-rc.1`.

```
tags   --- v2.3.12  --------------------- v2.4.0-rc ----- v2.4.0-rc.1
master ---   A      ---------------------   B  ---------------> C
              \                            / \                 /
                --- new_feature_branch ----    --- bug_fix ---
```

### Release

Use the following script to release a public version.

    npm run publish

It will install dependencies, run all the tests and let you tweak the version to be released. It will first upload to npm and then to the CDN.

If you are going to release a patch, and you have followed the workflow, you will have some hotfix changes in master that have not been released yet. In this case, you can release from master.

If you are releasing a minor or major, you should create a branch `release/<version>` from develop and do the release procedure from there. When you are done you can merge it into master, and merge master into develop.

For the time being, all packages are published every time, even if there are no changes.

## Changelog

CHANGELOG.md is automatically generated when doing a release using conventional commits via lerna.

## CSS Variables

To achieve a better customization we use [css variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables). Follow these rules in order to write them in a consistent way.

We define two kinds of variables, global and specific:

- **Global Values:** This variables are declared in `styles/core.scss` under the `:root` selector and define specific values that are available on every css scope.
- **Global Variables:** This variables are declared in `styles/core.scss` under the `:root` selector and are available on every css scope.
- **Specific Values:** This variables are declared in the element/component styles and define a value that can be used in different places, usually specific variables. (Same value could be used in the table border and paragraph color)
- **Specific Variables:** This variables are defined in the styles of element/component and they're only  available under the element/component scope.

The variables should have a less specific one as fallback, so for example when developing the `stacked-bar` widget:

```css

  /** <style/core/core.scss> The values are initialized **/
  --as--color--primary: white;

  /** <stacked-bar-widget.scss> The values used with chained fallbacks, last fallback is a css-value **/
  --as--stacked-bar-widget--background-color: var(--as--widget__header--background-color, --as--color--primary);
```

With `--as--stacked-bar-widget--background-color` users can control specific widgets, with the shared variable `--as--widget__header--background-color` they can control all widgets, or they can just redefine the default value `--as--color--primary`.


### Naming

To keep things consistent we use a standard css naming:

#### Global css-values

    --as--<type>--<name>

- Use the `as` namespace to prevent naming collisions
- `<type>`refers to the content of the variable: `color`, `size`, `font`.
- `<name>`is the identifier of the variable: `primary`, `dark`, `big`.

#### Global css-variables

    --<element>--<property>--<modifier>

- `<element>`refers to element/component the variable affects: `as-map-footer`, `as-histogram-widget__header`.
- `<property>`is the css property affected: `background-color`, `margin`, `height`, `padding-left`.
- `<modifier>`use this when the variable refers to a altered status: `hover`, `focus`.


#### Specific css-values

    --<element>--<type>--<name>

- `<element>`refers to element/component the variable affects: `as-map-footer`, `as-histogram-widget__header`.
- `<type>`refers to the content of the variable: `color`, `size`, `font`.
- `<name>`is the identifier of the variable: `primary`, `dark`, `big`.


#### Specific css-variables

    --<element>--<property>--<modifier>

- `<element>`refers to element/component the variable affects: `as-map-footer`, `as-histogram-widget__header`.
- `<property>`is the css property affected: `background-color`, `margin`, `height`, `padding-left`.
- `<modifier>`use this when the variable refers to a altered status: `hover`, `focus`.
