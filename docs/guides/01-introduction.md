## What is Airship ?

Airship are a set of tools designed to facilitate the development of location intelligence apps by offering layouts, basic patterns, templates, CSS classes, components, widgets and much more. Apps created with Airship will have a consistent UI and an propper UX validated and tested by CARTO.

Airship is currently composed of three fundamental parts that can be used separately: A CSS framework, a series of web-components and a set of icons.

In a Location Intelligence application you can distinguish two parts: the map itself and everything else. Contrary to what you might think, Airship is not used to render maps, to do this you have to use one of our map rendering libraries [CARTO.js](/developers/carto-js/) or [CARTO-VL](/developers/carto-vl/).

Airship is responsible for the layout and UI of the application. Once you have the map, Airship is used to generate, for instance, a sidebar and its contents or the map's legends.
