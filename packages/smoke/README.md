# Smoke testing

The aim of this folder is to provide an easy way to do smoke tests on Airship. This folder contains two dashboards generated with the `prerelase` version of Airship allowing manual before releasing a public version.

> Note, this should be a "temporal fix" and we need to automate this process as much as possible.

## Getting started

- Open the CDN version in different browsers and check everything is working as expected.
- The Npm version is a little different because you need to download and rebuild the example using the new `prerelease` version.
  - TIP: you can just run `npm start` to have everything working.
