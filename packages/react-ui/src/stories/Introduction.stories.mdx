# Airship UI for React (v3.0.0-alpha5)

## How to add a new Story
Put your `stories.js` files inside the `src/stories` folder following the same folder structure as the source files. For example:
`stories/widgets/FormulaWidgetUI.stories.js` for `src/widgets/FormulaWidgetUI.js` component.

As long as we are using a decorator to inject the MaterialUI theme, you just need to import and add your component to the `template` of your story.
```js
import React from 'react';
import FormulaWidgetUI from '../../widgets/FormulaWidgetUI';

const Template = (args) => <FormulaWidgetUI {...args} />;
```

Then, export your story and the different variations:
```js
export default {
  title: 'Widgets/FormulaWidgetUI',
  component: FormulaWidgetUI,
};

export const Empty = Template.bind({});
Empty.args = {};

export const Text = Template.bind({});
Text.args = { data: '$1000000'};
```

Optionally, you can add some extra controls to your story, but by default Storybook will add automatic controls for your story arguments.
